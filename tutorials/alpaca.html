<h1>Alpacas</h1>
<p>
An alpaca is a domesticated species of
South American camelid. It resembles a
small llama in appearance.

Despite being cute and fluffy, alpacas
are well known as spitters. They take
after their camel cousins in this way.

<h2>Alpaca Hair</h2>
<p>
The hair of an alpaca is very fine and
very warm. It is often turned into yarn,
then used to knit super warm socks and
toasty beanies.
</p>
<H2>Habitat</H2>
<p>
Alpacas originate from South America,
where they live high in the mountains.
Here in New Zealand, however, they are
more often found grazing in paddocks
or chilling out with herds of horses.
