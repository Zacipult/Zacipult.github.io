      The Bundesens say that Tardar Sauce's face appears grumpy because the feline has a form of dwarfism. She and her brother Pokey were born to normal parents with "a flat face, bubble eyes, and a short tail". Tardar Sauce is undersized and has hind legs that "are a bit different".

      Grumpy Cat appears in Lil Bub & Friendz, a documentary premiered at the Tribeca Film Festival on April 18, 2013 and won the Tribeca Online Festival Best Feature Film. In May 2013, Broken Road Productions optioned Grumpy Cat for a "Garfield-like feature film" adaptation. Producer Todd Garner said "We think we can build a big family comedy around this character."
